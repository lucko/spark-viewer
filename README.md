# spark-viewer
This repository contains the website & viewer for [spark](https://github.com/lucko/spark), written using [React](https://reactjs.org).

The viewer supports two modes:
* viewing the output from the spark profiler
* viewing the output from spark heap dump summaries

Content storage is handled by a [separate service](https://github.com/lucko/bytebin).
